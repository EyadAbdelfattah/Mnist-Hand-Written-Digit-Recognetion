# Mnist-Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition

This project demonstrates a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model trained to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is implemented in Python using popular libraries like TensorFlow/Keras and focuses on achieving accurate digit recognition.

## Overview

The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can classify these images with high accuracy. This repository contains the code for loading the dataset, training the DNN model, and evaluating its performance.

### Project Features:
- **Preprocessing:** Loads and normalizes the MNIST dataset.
- **Model Architecture:** Defines a simple yet effective DNN model for image classification.
- **Training:** Trains the model on the MNIST training set and evaluates it on the test set.
- **Evaluation:** Outputs accuracy and loss metrics for model performance.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:
